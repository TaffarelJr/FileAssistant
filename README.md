## Conventional Commits

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
to standardize the formatting of commit messages and
automate processes such as versioning and the generation of release notes.
While not strictly required,
it's still highly recommended to follow this standard
as it helps maintain the Semantic Versioning strategy.

To help with this, a Git message template is available by running
`git config commit.template .gitmessage` from the root of the repo.
It should then be visible whenever you run `git commit` while excluding the `-m`,
or in whatever other Git tool you prefer to use. This
[Cheat sheet](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conventional_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)
by Bogdan Popescu can help with the message format if you're new to CC.
